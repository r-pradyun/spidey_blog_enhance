When I saw the challenge name‚Äî**"ZONEy.eno"**‚Äîit immediately screamed **DNS** at me. And with UDP port `5007` open, I knew I was dealing with something interesting. Time to roll up my sleeves and start digging (pun absolutely intended).  

---

## **Checking What‚Äôs Running on Port 5007**  

First, I needed to figure out what was actually running on this port. So, I fired up **Nmap**:  

```bash
nmap -p 5007 52.59.124.14 -sCV
```

Boom! The scan confirmed that this was a **DNS server**, specifically running **NLnet Labs NSD**.  
Alright, time to throw some DNS queries at it and see what sticks.  

---

## **Asking the Obvious Question**  

A good starting point in any DNS challenge is to just ask for **everything** using an `ANY` query.  

```bash
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ANY zoney.eno
```

This gave me a **Start of Authority (SOA) record**, which told me the nameservers handling this domain:  

```
ns1.zoney.eno
ns2.zoney.eno
```

Nice to know, but not exactly what I was looking for. No flag in sight yet, so time to dig deeper.  

---

## **Throwing Random Guesses at the Server**  

A lot of times, CTF challenges hide flags in **subdomains**. So, I tried querying some common ones:  

```bash
for sub in flag hidden secret backup test admin; do
    dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ANY $sub.zoney.eno
done
```

Every single one came back with **NXDOMAIN**, which is the DNS equivalent of getting ghosted.  
Either I was looking in the wrong places, or the server had something sneaky going on.  

---

## **Time to Bring in the NSEC Trick**  

Since normal queries weren‚Äôt getting me anywhere, I decided to check if the server had **DNSSEC** enabled:  

```bash
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ANY zoney.eno +dnssec
```

The response included **RRSIG** records, which meant **DNSSEC was in play**. But that wasn‚Äôt what I was really after.  

Instead, I turned to **NSEC queries**. These are meant to *prove* that certain domains don‚Äôt exist, but sometimes they accidentally **expose valid subdomains**.  

So, I asked:  

```bash
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 NSEC zoney.eno
```

And jackpot! The response revealed a new subdomain:  

```
challenge.zoney.eno
```

Alright, that looked promising.  

---

## **Checking Out This ‚ÄúChallenge‚Äù Subdomain**  

Now that I had a lead, I queried the new subdomain:  

```bash
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ANY challenge.zoney.eno
```

It pointed to `127.0.0.1`.  
Wait, what?  

A **loopback address?** That‚Äôs a classic CTF move‚Äîredirecting traffic back to itself.  
This wasn‚Äôt the final destination, which meant I had to **NSEC-walk** further.  

```bash
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 NSEC challenge.zoney.eno
```

And sure enough, it led me to another subdomain:  

```
hereisthe1337flag.zoney.eno
```

That had to be it.  

---

## **Going for the Final Query**  

I ran the last command to grab whatever was hiding in there:  

```bash
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ANY hereisthe1337flag.zoney.eno
```

And there it was. The **flag** was chilling in a **TXT record**:  

```bash
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 TXT hereisthe1337flag.zoney.eno
```


```
ENO{1337_Fl4G_NSeC_W4LK3R}
```

## **Takeaways from This Challenge**  

This was a **classic case of NSEC-walking**, where a misconfigured DNSSEC setup accidentally leaks valid subdomains.  

Moral of the story? If a challenge involves **DNS**, don't just fire random queries and hope for the best. **Use NSEC queries to uncover hidden zones.**  

Alright, time to move on to the next challenge. Hopefully, it‚Äôs not another DNS one...
